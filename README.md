project gives us a better experience that can be used in developing real time projects in coming
future.
This project is nothing but developing a distributed database system for tourism/tourist
application. Various phase of this project involves a database with several tables linked and has
tourist information and in phase two we will be developing a standard web page that linked to
the tourist database to retrieve tourist information.

EXISTING SYSTEM:
In the present scenario, a customer has to visit various agencies and offices to plan a tour.
The customer has to make reservations for travel and accommodation. The customer may have 
to collect information from various sources. It takes a lot of time to plan a tour and often the data
may not be up to date.
PROPOSED SYSTEM:
The proposed system maintains a centralized repository of all related information such as tour
packages, places, hotels and enables one to make reservations for various transportation modes.
The system provides all the help and information that a customer generally requires. The system
allows one to browse through all the details and information.
